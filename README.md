## Some tricks used in the project

1. Use **interpolation method**. It is the process of embedding an expression into part of a string. symbols used are **` `**.
2. Getting rid of doing 'nodemon index.js' again and again change in package.json scripts making 
**"start":"nodemon index.js"** so now do in terminal **npm start**.


## Initial steps to create a folder and directory structure

1. Create a **codeial** folder which is the project name.
2. Create a **index.js** file which is the server file.
3. First initialize the project using **npm init** which install the **package.json** then do the required things to setup the project. 
4. Now for making a project scalable I first make directories using **mkdir** command in git bash terminal.
5. The initial directories are **routes, controllers, views, models, config**. There will be more. But this is our structure.


## Firing the Express server and defining port on which it should run.

1. Install **Express** by using **npm install express**. This will be in **package-lock.json**. And will create node_modules folder which contains all the dependencies which express will required. To check we can see in package.json there will be dependency naming express and the version.
2. It should be require in the entry point server i.e index.js. **const express=require('express');**
3. Next step is to call the express server by : **const app=express();**
4. Now define a port where the server will run on browser by: **const port=8000;**
5. Now to bind and listen the connections on the specified port we use:**app.listen(port,function(err){});**
6. Now for testing that server is running or not we use: **nodemon index.js**


## Adding git to the project so to easily track the changes.
1. First initialize git by: **git init**.
2. Then we don't want to upload **node_modules** folder as it is very large and it can be easily install so we add this to **.gitignore file**.
3. Now next step is to add every thing to git by: **git add .**
